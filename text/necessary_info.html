<u><p><b>Security in the house</b></u></p>
<p><b>Locking &ndash; and security in general</b><br>
In Spain one should be more careful with locking the doors than for instance in Scandinavia.<br>
Generally there are few brutal crimes in Spain, but they can easily empty the house if you give them a chance! Especially if there is travelling Rumanians in the area. Please don&rsquo;t even let them into the property if they try to contact you from the front gate as they can rob you in a moment. Please also be aware that there are persons whose money, credit cards, watches etc. have been robbed by persons that stop you in town and want to give you a rose etc., they do it even without you noticing it. Therefore, refuse and avoid people that want to give you roses!</p>
<p><b>Locking when you stay in the house. IMPORTANT!</b><br>
So far we have only good experiences in the house and feel that we live in a safe environment. If you follow some few and simple precautions you can also avoid unpleasant episodes.<br>
Here is a good rule, which we inherit from the old owner of the house: <b>When you stay at the back side of the house, always lock the front side, and when you stay at the front side of the house, always lock the back side &ndash; ALWAYS! </b>The front gate and the front garage gate should <b><u>always</u></b> be locked (either you are in the house or not).</p>
<p><b>Locking when we leave the house during daytime, and when we go to bed at night</b><br>
Front side of the house: The iron door outside should be locked and the wooden door inside should be locked or at least the horizontal iron bars closed when we are inside the house and be locked with key if you leave the house or are going to bed.<br>
When you leave the house, please ALWAYS activate the alarm.<br>
The window roller shutters should always be lowered when you leave the house, and when you go to bed, but the windows inside can be a bit open if you like good ventilation in the bedroom (turn the window handle up and the window open inward about 100 mm). During daytime, after ventilating in the morning, it can also be a good idea to close the window roller shutters in order to prevent bigger insects to come in.<br>
Cockroaches can appear, but very seldom. Since they can carry bacteria and leave a lot of eggs we don&rsquo;t like them to visit us. Keeping the house clean, and most of all, do not leave leftover food on the floor and tables etc. is a good precaution.</p>
<p><b>Keys</b><br>
The keys you have got will fit most of the doors. Keys for the terrace and the pump house by the pool are on the shelf above the fire place. We would appreciate if you could put them back to the same place when you stay there and when you leave.<br>
One of the keys you have got will fit the back door from the garden (behind the swimming pool) and this is a short cut for those who use the train (only a couple of minutes&rsquo; walk from this side).</p>
<p><b>To remember when you arrive at the house</b><br>
When you have time, it would be nice if you could clean, dry, fold and put back into the cabinet in the corridor, used bed sheets etc. which you will find in the laundry box in the kitchen next to the washing machine (from the previous guests).</p>
<p><b>To remember before you leave the house and travel home</b><br>
Maybe it is a good idea to have a to-do list before you leave, so here is a suggestion:<br>
• Window roller shutters should be lowered. Handles on the windows in the two small bedrooms should be turned up and the windows opened inward (about 100mm) into ventilation position. Doors, iron doors and gates should be closed and alarm should be activated.<br>
• Washing machine and dishwasher should be emptied and the doors kept a little bit open (not totally closed).<br>
• The fridge and the freezer should be cleaned and emptied for unnecessary things and things that cannot be stored.<br>
• Garbage from kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms, office etc. should be put in plastic bags and put out on the street close to the front gate.&nbsp;<br>
• Except from that it would be nice if one can dust clean and use the mop to clean the floors so that it is nice and clean for the next guests (leave it the way you would like it to be when you arrive is a good motto)! p.s. mop is in the cabinet in the kitchen or in the cabinet in the corridor.<br>
• <b>Important:</b> All cabinet doors and doors between rooms <u>should</u> be left a little bit open when you leave in order to avoid humidity. The same is for the ventilators.<br>
• During winter time it is an advantage if the windows are closed and the air condition on 18 degrees Celsius.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Dryer for clothes</b><br>
In the office (last cabinet on the right hand side) you will find the dryer for clothes.&nbsp;<br>
p.s. Remember to empty the water container every time you use it.</p>
<p><b>Hot water tank (bathroom)</b><br>
The switch for the hot water tank to the bathrooms is located in the cabinet in the office (in the cabinet on the left hand side behind the door).<br>
p.s. It takes some time from opening the tap until you get hot water.</p>
<p><b>Hot water tank for the kitchen</b><br>
There is a separate hot water tank for the kitchen and it is located in the office in the last cabinet on the right hand side.</p>
<p><b>Tools</b><br>
You will find some tools in the first and second drawers on the right hand side of the working desk in the office. &nbsp;On the right hand side inside the door (in the shelves) you will also find an electrical drill.<br>
