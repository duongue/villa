in Los Boliches and in Fuengirola as these newspapers are printed in Spain.

<p><strong>Beaches
</strong><br>
There are a lot of beaches along the Costa Del Sol. Biggest beaches are
both in Fuengirola and in Torremolinos. The closest beach is down the road and
to the right or the left (about 5 minutes). You can also take the train to
Torreblanca or Los Boliches (2 and 3 stop towards Fuengirola) and you will find
beaches all along that coastline. Alternatively you can take the train to the
other direction to Benalmadena or Torremolinos but here the distance to the
beach is longer.
</p>
<p><strong>Zoo &amp; Safari Parks
</strong><br>
You can find several zoos in Fuengirola, but the biggest Safari Park in
the area is SELWO Costa del Sol. It is located close to Estepona south of
Marbella. Drive south on N-340 and the place is called Las Lomas del Monte.
</p>
<p><strong>Water Parks
</strong><br>
Several places along
the Costa del Sol you will find water parks. The closest is in Fuengirola.
</p>
<p><strong>Tivoli
</strong><br>
In Benalm&agrave;dena, it is the largest Tivoli on the coast. If you take the
train against Malaga from Torremuelle station, it is only one
stop to &rdquo;Benalm&agrave;dena Arroyo De La Mile&rdquo;. Turn left about 160 degrees and you will find
the entrance to the Tivoli after about 200 meter walking.
<br>
In case you bring children, be a bit careful and not allowing them into
the scary &ldquo;ghost house&rdquo; etc. p.s. These places can certainly also scare adults.
<br>
In the Tivoli you also find many restaurants,
shops etc.
</p>
<p><strong>Grocery store/supermarket
</strong><br>
You will find two stores down the street from
the house. The first one on the left hand side after the first roundabout is
English. The second one is located to the left after the second roundabout and
is Spanish. The second one has opening hours normally from 10:00 - 14:00 and
from 17:00 - 22:00 and it is closed on Sunday afternoon. The English one is
open daily from 08:00 - 20:00 and 10:00 - 1600 on Sundays. There is also a big Supermercado (El Corte
Igles) by the train station in Los Boliches (3 train stops towards Fuengirola).
This supermercado has both bakery and fresh fish and meat. <u>
</u></p>
<p><strong>Shopping
</strong><br>
<strong><em>Los Boliches
</em></strong><br>
Los Boliches is our so-called closest shopping area.
<br>
If you go by car, drive down the street and turn right. Then drive straight
forward through several roundabouts until you see the sign &ldquo;Los Boliches&rdquo;. Then
follow the sign and you will arrive at the railway station (most likely above
you!). You will also see El Corte Igles and on the ground floor of this
building there is a parking house which is almost always vacant.
<br>
Alternatively, and easier, take the train from Torremuelle station (go out
from the back door of the garden and turn right and walk for 2 minutes). Take
the train towards Fuengirola, but get off at Los Boliches (3 stops &ndash; and last
before end station Fuengirola).
<br>
In Los Boliches/Fuengirola you will find the market, bakeries, supermarket,
hair dresser etc. or most of essential shops. In addition you will find a lot
of restaurants on the sea side.
<br>
Around Fuengirola station (preferably down one street and to the right (in
the area around the small church), you will also find a lot of shops for those
who are interested in shopping (or windows shopping).
<br>
From both Los Boliches and Fuengirola station, it is short distance to
the long beach in Fuengirola. Fuengirola also has a big market which is usually
every Tuesday.
<br>
In Fuengirola you can also rent scooters, bowling, discotheque, internet
caf&eacute;, they have London club (football) and a lot of restaurants, etc.
<br>
<p><strong><em>La Ca&ntilde;ada</em></strong><br>
This is most likely the largest indoor
shopping center in the Costa del Sol. If you look for &ldquo;all in one place&rdquo;, this
might be it!&nbsp; La Ca&ntilde;ada is centrally located above the highway and above Marbella.
</p>
<p><strong><em>Plaza Mayor
</em></strong><br>
This is also a shopping center next to the
railway station Plaza Major, one or two stops before Malaga Airport. The
shopping center is open from 11:00 to 22:00 every day. Remember that there is
one center behind the first center (behind the parking place).
</p>
<p><strong>Hair dresser &ndash; Barber shop
</strong><br>
There are several possibilities both for ladies and gentlemen. We can
suggest Peluqueria Unisex which is located on Los Bolishes No. 56 (the street
in Los Boliches). The simplest way to get to this shop is to take the train from
the house towards Fuengirola
and get off in Los Boliches. When you get off the train you go down one street
and turn right. After some hundred meters passing by the church you will see it
on the left hand side. &nbsp;
</p>
<p><strong>Restaurants
</strong><br>
You find restaurants everywhere and most of them serve good food. Some
have tender and good meat, and others are very good at seafood and salads.&nbsp;
<br>
If you look for a cosy and simple meal close to the house, you can find
at least two or three restaurants down the street. The restaurant LUCENA II, situated
at the corner of the second roundabout has good service and good food.
<br>
You can alternatively take the train to the end station in Fuengirola
and go down towards the sea and turn a bit to the right, there is a big
restaurant street with only restaurants where you can find almost all kind of
food.
<br>
