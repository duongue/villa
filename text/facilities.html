<p><strong>Alarm</strong><br>
In the house there is an installed alarm. Whenever you leave the house, the alarm should be activated, and then de-activated when you get home and go inside.&nbsp;<br>
The display is on the wall on the right hand side after the mirror. If it is dark in the corridor when you arrive, there is a light switch close to the display.<br>
When you leave the house and only the last person is ready by the display, <u>stand still with you hand ready to activate the alarm, but</u> <u><strong>wait until you see a steady green light in the display</strong></u>. When you see the steady green light, calmly push the code. You will then have 14 seconds to go outside and lock the doors.<br>
When you come back and open the door to enter the house, you will have about 10 seconds to go to the display and enter the code.&nbsp;<br>
If you by a mistake set the wrong code, just set the correct code. If you are fast enough it is ok and if not you may activate the alarm. If you are too late, push the button marked &ldquo;Cancellation&rdquo; further down on the display. It is possible that the alarm/security company calls you on the house telephone and will ask you to give them the correct code (they speak English). If they do, tell them you are guests and give them the correct code. By pushing the &ldquo;Cancellation&rdquo; button we prevent them from driving to our house. Telephone to Alarma Universal S.A. is 902 30 15 10&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Air conditioning</strong><br>
You will find air-conditioning in the big bedroom and in the living room.&nbsp;<br>
During summer when it is fairly warm, it can be an advantage to turn on the AC in the evening a couple of hours before bedtime. We recommend 24 &ndash; 25 degrees Celsius (depending on what you like) and if you push the button &ldquo;Quiet&rdquo; it will not make much noise. When you go to bed, you can either turn it off or adjust it up to 27-28 degrees Celsius and let it stay like that during the night. If you want cooler temperature in the room as well as in the other bedrooms, the best thing is to open the doors between the bedrooms. Anyway remember to keep the door from the bedrooms&rsquo; corridor to the living room closed when you use the air-conditioner and want it cool in the bedrooms otherwise all the cold air will disappear into the living room!&nbsp;<br>
P.S. It is easy to catch a cold when using air-conditioning, that&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t recommend less than 27 degrees Celsius if you use it at night!&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool &amp; Sunbeds</strong><br>
In the back garden you will find a swimming pool. Depth: 1.4m &ndash; 1.8m, Length: 15m.&nbsp;<br>
The gardener will maintain the swimming pool. He will refill water, adjust the use of tablets, &ldquo;dust clean&rdquo; etc.<br>
The only thing which is nice if you can do is to remove leaves and other small things that come with the wind and end up in the swimming pool.&nbsp;<br>
You will find sun beds in the back garden or in the garage and sun mattress and pillows for the chairs in the back garden in the pillow case behind the house.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TV &amp; Satellite</strong><br>
NRK 1 is normally on Chanel 84. In addition to the parabol antenna with different TV and radio channels, there is also a DVD player and some films in the upper book shelf.</p>
<p><strong>Radio</strong><br>
There is a Tivoli radio in the kitchen that has re-chargeable battery therefore you can bring it to the terrace or the back garden if you wish.<br>
Normally you will find Scandinavian radio on FN 105 and it is usually in Norwegian between 1200 and 1300. On frequency 101.7 you will find German news and music. In addition, you will find NRK P1 and some music channels on the TV-radio.</p>
<p><strong>Telephone</strong><br>
Cordless phone can be found in the office. If you want to use the telephone, please add 1077 before dialing the normal number (for example: 1077 0047&hellip;).</p>

All-in-one (Epson copy, printer and scanner) is in the office and is WI-FI (wireless).&nbsp;<br>
If you cannot get the wireless to function, please connect with the cable to your laptop.<br>

WI-FI password: XE09153454F2C</p>
<p><strong>Dishwasher&nbsp;</strong><br>
You will find dishwasher in the kitchen and it functions well.<br>
Remember to refill salt in the bottom of the dishwasher some time (salt and tablets for the dishwashing you will find under the sink. If you run out, please buy new package).</p>
<p><strong>The washing machine</strong><br>
The washing machine in the kitchen is hopefully self-explaining. The washing powder should be filled in box no. II. Washed clothes can be hung up behind the house. Washing powder can be found in the cabinet to the left of the washing machine. If you run out of washing powder, please buy new package.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dryer</strong><br>
You will find the dryer for the clothes in the last cabinet on the right hand side in the office. Remember to empty the water container after each time you use the dryer.</p>
<p><strong>Fuse cabinet</strong><br>
You will find the fuse cabinet in the wall of the kitchen. It is automatic fuses. If they fall out, please wait a little bit and turn it on (up) again.</p>
<p><strong>Kitchen</strong><br>
The kitchen should be fully equipped with induction stove, oven, dishwasher, coffee machine, fridge, freezer, water cooker, rice cooker, etc.&nbsp;<br><br>
<u>Dishwasher</u><br>
<ul>
<li>Please feel free to use the dishwasher, but when you are about to leave the house, please make sure that it is empty and remember to keep the door to the dishwasher open.</li>
<li>When using the dishwasher: Before using the dishwasher, please add a &ldquo;washing tablet&rdquo; and close the &ldquo;door&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The different programs for use of the dishwasher are found on the door itself and you will see it when you open the door.</li>
<li>Push first the bottom to the right, then push the &ldquo;auto&rdquo; button and finally push the &ldquo;start&rdquo; button to the right, before you close the door.</li>
<li>You will see a red light shining down on the floor as a sign that it has been activated. This light will go off when the program is finished.</li></ul>
Please also remember regularly to add special salt in the dispenser at the bottom of the dishwasher (inside &ndash; you see it when opening the door. Washing tablets and salt are located in the cabinet under the sink. If it gets empty, please buy more.<br><br>
<u>Freezer and Refrigerator&nbsp;</u><br>
If you are not told otherwise before you arrive in the house, the principle is that you can freely use food and drinks you find in the fridge or freezer. We think this is a good idea to avoid guests having to throw away a lot of food and drinks before they leave.<br>
We still recommend that you check and dispose food etc. that is out of date or that you are not confident about. We would also appreciate if you keep fridge and freezer clean and tidy and especially before you leave, so that it is nice for the guests coming after you.<br><br>
One <u>important</u> issue: There is no magnetic sealing on the freezer door. The door will therefore not close automatically. Please therefore make sure that it is properly closed every time you have opened it!!</p>
<p><strong>Grill</strong><br>
The grill is located on the terrace.</p>
<p><strong>Bed sheets and towels</strong><br>
In the big cabinet in the corridor (by the entrance) you will find bed sheets and towels, toilet paper, iron, iron table, dust cleaner, etc.<br>
When it is summer and warm, single bed sheets will be enough, and when it is winter you can use the duvet. Blankets and duvet can be found in the cabinets in the bedrooms.<br>
The used bed sheets can be put in the laundry basket next to the washing machine before you leave. P.S. If you have time, it will of course be nice if you can wash them! Be careful with wet towels etc. and remember to have the door of the laundry basket open and hang humid sheets and towels over the edge of the laundry basket. Wet towels can preferably be hung on some of the inside doors. When you arrive, you may see that there are used sheets and towels in the basket and on some of the doors from the guests who have been there before you. It is nice if you can wash, fold and put them back in place. We think this is a good solution since some guests leave early in the morning and do not have enough time to wash and dry all the sheets and towels before leaving.</p>
<p><strong>Garbage&nbsp;</strong><br>
Plastic bags for garbage should be located under the sink. When you run out of plastic bags, it is nice if you can re-fill. Remember to tighten a knot on the bags before you carry them out and leave them on the street close to the front gate, preferably before 10.00 a.m. every day except Sundays.<br>
If you have garbage on Sundays you can also drop it in the containers close to Lucena II restaurant (after the road bridge on the left hand side). Here you can also deliver plastic, carton and paper, glass etc.</p>
<p><strong>Bucket cabinet</strong><br>
You will find necessary tools and equipment for cleaning in the first cabinet on the left hand side in the kitchen, alternatively in the main cabinet in the corridor close to the entrance door. In the big cabinet in the corridor you will also find things like iron and iron board, vacuum cleaner, toilet paper etc. P.S. If you run out of toilet paper, please refill!</p>
<p><strong>Gardener</strong><br>
Our nice gardener is called Salvador. His telephone number is 649 750967.&nbsp;<br>
He does all the garden work such as cutting the lawn, maintaining the garden, watering, cleaning etc. Please be friendly with him since he is a very nice and important person for us.<br>
P.S: He also maintains the swimming pool.&nbsp;<br>
Since the property is well protected and you have privacy, it is nice to know WHEN the gardener comes to our property. He is with us on Monday, Wednesday and Friday and he will be there some time between 0800 and 1100. Sometimes he doesn&rsquo;t do much, other time he has a lot to do &ndash; also depending on the seasons.<br>
P.S. &nbsp;Please don&rsquo;t do his work or he will be frustrated.&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Wingdings; font-size: 11pt">J</span><br>
Salvador speaks Spanish and very little English, BUT with a smile and body language you can quite easily understand a simple conversation with him.</p>
<p><strong>Light switches</strong><br>
Some light switches can be hard to find.&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Wingdings; font-size: 11pt">J</span><br>
The light switch to one of the terrace lights is on the wall behind the TV. The other one is inside the door to the terrace.<br>
P.S. The light switch to the main light above the dining table has a dimmer. Hold the button down for a while and the light will get weaker or stronger. Try also to press one side of the switch. The switch on the two yellow bedrooms has also dimmer!</p>
<p><strong>Iron and iron board</strong><br>
Iron and iron board is in the big cabinet in the corridor.</p>
<p><strong>Children chair and children trolley</strong><br>
The children chair is normally to be found in one of the bedrooms. The children trolley is stored in the upper shelf in the big cabinet in the corridor (by the main door).</p>
<p><strong>Wine</strong><br>
You might find some wine in the cabinet on the left hand side in the office. You can use this wine if you like, but then please leave some Euros in the purse so that there is money to refill them later.&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Wingdings; font-size: 11pt">J</span><br>
These wine bottles are not the cheapest possible wine but they are a selection of fairly good wine selected by a Swedish wine distributor (and captain) called Morgan Skantz.</p>
<p><strong>Water hose</strong><br>
There is one water hose on the terrace and one in the back garden. You are free to use them when you see the need.</p>
<p><strong>&rdquo;Public stock&rdquo;&nbsp;</strong><span style="font-family: Wingdings; font-size: 11pt">J</span><br>
A selection of sun protection, shampoo and other &ldquo;travelling items&rdquo; can be found in the cabinet on the left hand side in the office (below the wine).<br>
Some leave leftovers before they travel home and others use them when they come and stay. In this way we hope to be environmentally friendly.</p>
<p><strong>Books, maps, DVD`s</strong><br>
Books, maps and DVD`s can be found in the book shelf in the living room. Books and novels can also be found in the first cabinet on the left hand side in the office.</p>
